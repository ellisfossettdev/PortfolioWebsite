<!-- Personal Statement Text -->

    <div class="main-formatting">
        <p>"I am a lifelong computer enthusiast aiming to transition into the video game industry. Video games have always been a significant part of my life, and I completed my third and final year of university in May 2024, graduating with a first-class degree (1:1) in BSc (Hons) Game Design in October 2024.

            Since graduation, I have been actively seeking opportunities within the game industry, particularly in programming, technical art, or quality assurance roles. In addition to my academic pursuits and personal projects, I continuously seek to enhance my skills through online learning platforms such as Udemy, where I have self-taught Blender, Substance Painter, and Adobe Illustrator. I have also recently started learning French using Duolingo.
            
            My ultimate goal is to leverage these skills to fulfil my dream of having my name featured in the credits of a video game, movie, or television show." </p>

<!-- Personal Interest Text -->

    <div class="main-formatting">
        <p>I have always been passionate about games and technology. Since college, I have developed an addiction to learning new software through online courses. By completing various Udemy courses, I constantly strive to improve my existing skills and expand my knowledge, all with the goal of securing a career in the games industry.

          In addition to honing my technical abilities, I enjoy exploring emerging technologies such as 3D printing and virtual reality. I also have a strong interest in building PCs, which allows me to stay hands-on with hardware and deepen my understanding of the tools that power modern gaming experiences.</p>

          <p>When it came time to choose my GCSEs, I knew I wanted to focus on subjects that involved working with computers. I chose Computer Science, Photography, ICT, and Media. Through my Computer Science studies, I created my first website and developed my first puzzle game in Pythonâ€”experiences that sparked my passion for technology and creativity.

            After secondary school, I explored local colleges with the initial plan of studying Computer Science. However, my passion for game creation led me to discover a game development course at a nearby college. Over three years, I immersed myself in game design and graduated with the highest possible grade of Distinction*Distinction*Distinction.
            
            After completing college, I decided against attending university immediately, opting instead to continue my retail job while working on independent game projects in my spare time. However, in January 2021, I was made redundant from my retail position. This pivotal moment motivated me to pursue higher education, and I enrolled in university to study BSc (Hons) Games Design. I graduated with First-Class Honours, achieving a significant milestone in my journey toward a career in game development.</p>
